This document contains notes concerning the website implementation.

- The creds.php file contains all the database login information.
  Its location is in public_html. If you need database access via php,
  make sure to include 'creds.php'.  Check the file for variable names.

- The public_html folder is set up so that all parts of the website
  requiring authorized access should be put in the auth folder.

- At the top of every publicly-accessible document in the auth folder,
  include 'session.php'.  This php routine checks if the user is logged
  in and kicks out unauthorized users.  The include statement
  must be included before any other code or html; otherwise, it will not
  work.

- Include logout.php on every publicly-accessible page located
  in the auth folder. This routine deallocates all session variables,
  returns the page to the login, and deactivates any cookies.

- The session variables available (if session.php is included)
  are id, active_portfolio, username, and a hashed password.

- All 3rd party libraries are located in public_html/dist.

- PHP interfaces with the database through mysqli.

- In the auth folder, index.php contains the skeleton html and php for 
  the authorized sections of the website.  To navigate, index.php reads
  the query string and includes the file. For example, for the URL 
  index.php?portfolios, the file portfolios.php is included.
  The index.php file contains an array of valid include files.  If your file
  is not included in this array, it will not load.  Only files ending
  in .php will be included.

- The website relies heavily on Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery-ui and php. All
  are included in the distribution.

- Custom styling is included in auth/styles.css and signin.css.
