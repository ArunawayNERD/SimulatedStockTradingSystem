This document contains information on the StockEngine module of the SSTS system.
This document is intended for the system admin(s) or developers wishing to build
on the current system.

All the file which make up the stock engine module are found in the StockEngine Folder.

The core file is the StockApiModule.php This is the file responsible for pulling
the nasdaq and dowjones stock data. It does this by sending api calls to the 
yahoo finance api. 

In the Ticker folder there are two text files. These files contain strings
of up to 200 separate stock tickers. The StockApiModule builds the api call urls
by taking this lines form the text files. The lines are limited to 200 tickers 
because that is the limit set by yahoo per api call. 

In the StockData folder there are two.csv files. As the StockApiModule is pulling
data from the nasdaq and dowjones it is concatenated into the those two files.
when the cron job runs it moves that data into the stocks database.

Below is the documentation from the StockApiModule.php file
