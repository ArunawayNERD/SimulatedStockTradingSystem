- The creds.php file contains all the database login information.
  Its location is in public_html. If you need database access via php,
  make sure to include 'creds.php'.  Check the file for variable names.

- The public_html folder is set up so that all parts of the website
  requiring authorized access should be put in the auth folder.

- At the top of every publicly-accessible document in the auth folder,
  include 'session.php'.  This php routine checks if the user is logged
  in and kicks out unauthorized users.  The include statement
  must be included before any other code or html; otherwise, it will not
  work.

- Include logout.php on every publicly-accessible page located
  in the auth folder. This routine deallocates all session variables,
  returns the page to the login, and deactivates any cookies.
