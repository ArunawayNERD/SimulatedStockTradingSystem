Overview

Most of the tables are self-explanatory.  Users contains the registered
users. The passwords are hashed and salted by prepending the username
to the front of the password.

Portfolios stores stock portfolios.  The competition boolean 
indicates whether the portfolio is a competition portfolio

The status for the competition table can only be -1, 0, or 1.  The value
-1 means the competition is over; 0 means the competition has yet to begin,
and 1 means the competition is ongoing.

The players table is meant to relate each competitor with the 
competition and the non-competitive portfolio.

All tables in the database are in flux, with the exception of the
winners table.  The point of the winners table is store information
about competition results.  It contains no foreign keys so the
information need  not be deleted.  The column top1 is the portfolio
name of the top ranked player and top1value is the value of that
portfolio.

The database contains one trigger on the users table.  It is listed below.

create trigger default_portfolio 
after insert on users
for each row
    insert into portfolios 
      values (new.id, new.username, 100000, false);

The purpose of this trigger is to create a portfolio for the user
upon registration.  The portfolio name defaults to the name of the
registered user.
