- The creds.php file contains all the database login information.
  Its location is in public_html. If you need database access via php,
  make sure to include 'creds.php'.  Check the file for variable names.

- The public_html folder is set up so that all parts of the website
  requiring authorized access should be put in the auth folder.

- At the top of every publicly-accessible document in the auth folder,
  include 'session.php'.  This php routine checks if the user is logged
  in and kicks out unauthorized users.
